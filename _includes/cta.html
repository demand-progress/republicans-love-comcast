<h1>Tell Republican Lawmakers: Stop shilling for Big Cable</h1>
<p>
    Americans overwhelmingly support Net Neutrality, but several dozen Republicans who sit on the committees that oversee the Federal Communications Commission are trying to kill it.  They just signed a letter* in opposition to President Obama’s proposal to protect the Internet — and one of them even called Net Neutrality &ldquo;Obamacare for the Internet&rdquo;!  They’re just doing the bidding of Comcast, AT&amp;T, Time Warner, and the other big cable monopolies — who, incidentally, have donated hundreds thousands of dollars to their campaigns.
